== Introduction ==

This article contains an overview of breaking changes introduced in Ela 0.10.


== No mutable data structures ==

Ela 0.10 is a pure language and support for mutable data structures on a language level is dropped. Now it is not possible to declare a record with mutable fields, e.g. syntax like so:

{{{let rec = { !x = 0 }}}}

is no longer valid.

Also assignment operator `(<-)` is no longer supported. 
However mutation of state can be done through library support. Ela 0.10 comes with a standard Cell module that implements reference cells in OCaml style.

Mutation of data (Ela 0.9):

{{{let rec = { !value = 0 }
rec.value <- 1 $
rec.value }}}

Mutation of data (Ela 0.10):

{{{open Cell
let c = cell 0
c |> mutate 1 $
valueof c}}}


== Indexing ==

Indexing syntax (e.g. `foo.[bar]`) is no longer supported. A new indexing operator `(:)` is added to standard prelude. One can use it in all the cases where indexing operator was used.

Indexing (Ela 0.9):

{{{let xs = [1..10]
xs.[0]}}}

Indexing (Ela 0.10):

{{{let xs = [1..10]
xs:0
}}}

The same `(:)` would work for indices of any type:

{{{let rec = {x=1,y=2}
rec:"y"
}}}


== Name shadowing ==

Ela 0.10 supports name shadowing when names are declared in the same scope. The following code is now correct (used to produce compile errors):

{{{let x = 0
let x = 1

let foo = \x x -> x*x
}}}

It is important to understand that a lambda declaration `\x x -> x*x` doesn't contain a non-linear pattern (like a Prolog), but is defined according to the rules of lambda calculus - it is fully equivalent to: `\x -> \x -> x*x`. The same works for named functions as well.


== Application operators ==

Operators `(|>)` and `(<|)` in Ela 0.9 were just syntax sugar over function application - not actual functions. In Ela 0.10 these are functions defined in standard Prelude. One can override them if needed, partially apply, etc. Priority and associativity of these operators haven't changed.
