//As simple as possible:
"Hello, world!"

//OK, here we cheat a little bit. The trick is that program in Ela in an expression
//and yields a value. Both Ela Console (elac) and Elide print these expression in
//standard output. As a result we have a complete pure 'Hello, world!' program -
//without a single side effects.

//A more traditional way to the this is to call console IO functions explicitly which
//is also possible in Ela:

//open Con
//writen "Hello, world!"
