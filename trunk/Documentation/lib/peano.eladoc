This module contains an implementation of lazy peano numbers. Lazy peano numbers are used to represent
natural numbers including infinity. Because of their lazy nature it is possible to use them for such tasks
as represeting a length of an infinite list.

=Implementation notes
Peano numbers are pretty close to linked lists - moreover one can even imitate a peano number using a
linked list.//br
A peano number is represented as a recursive variant type with two tags - `Zero`, which is used to represent
a zero value, and `Succ`, which is used to represent any other value than zero.//br
Peano numbers are always evaluated in a lazy manner, as a result, when converting a integer value to
a peano number like so `toInt 42`, an actual conversion is done by demand only, e.g. when you would
need to compare this peano number with another number:
>>>x = fromIntegral 42 
>>>x > 5?
In the example a value `x` is evaluated only to the point, when it becomes clear that it is greater than
5. Therefore it is completely safe to perform such comparsions even with infinite peano numbers:
>>>infinity > 5?
Here we see that it is only needed to evaluate first six elements of an infinity to prove that it is
greater than 5. The same here:
>>>5? < infinity
However, a comparison like so:
>>infinity == infinity
would never terminate, because here we don't have any clear bounds, and Ela would hang in an infinite
evaluation loop. In other words, any comparison operation (including functions from `Eq` and `Ord`
classes) would result in non-termination if both left-hand side and right-hand side operands are an
infinity.//br
Except of comparison operations with infinity, non termination can arise in cases when you use `show`
function to format an peano number to string. This function is always evaluated in a strict manner,
and if you try to apply it to an infinity it would never terminate. Same for `toInt` and `toLong`
functions that are strict and would try to traverse the whole peano number structre. However, a `toList`
function is evaluated lazily and always returns a lazy list, therefore it is safe to apply this function
to an infinity.

=Arithmetic
All arithmetic operations are evaluated lazily, as a result one can safely write comparisons like so:
>>>infinity `div` 2? > 42?
Arithmetic operations never result in non-termination:
>>>y = infinity - infinity
as soon as they basically don't evaluate their arguments at all. This evaluation is only done by demand
by other functions, such as comparison functions or strict conversion functions.//br
Peano numbers can be seen as a form of unsigned integer numbers. However, the result of any calculation 
involving two peano numbers is always a peano number. Because of that, peano numbers don't support real
division and do not provide an instance for a `Field` class, however, they have an instance for `Integral`
class:
>>>toInt <| 5? `div` 2?
Another peculiarity of peano numbers is their unsigned nature. The minimum value of a peano number is
zero, therefore calculations that might otherwise result in a negative number would raise an exception.//br
However, for convinience, a `subtractNeg` function is provided that doesn't raise an exception but instead
returns a tuple where a first element is boolean, used to represent a sign (`true` for positive and `false`
for negative) and the second element is a peano number.

=Applications
Peano numbers can be used to represent lazy calculations, such as counting of elements in a lazy (and
possibly infinite) list. This module provides a `listLength` function that can be used in such a way:
>>>listLength [1..] > 5?
Another application is equation solving. Peano numbers allows an equation to be solved even if one of
the equation is indeterminate but you still need to prove certain statements about it, e.g.:
>>>infinity <> 0?
This equation is (logically) correct and should evaluate to true, however normally in order to evaluate
it one would have to fully evaluate the left-hand operand, which is infinity. Luckily this is not the
case for peano number, and this equation will hold.

#members

Peano
This type represents a lazy recursive peano number.

Bounded Peano
Implements functions `maxBound` and `minBound` for the `Peano` data type. Function `maxBound`
always returns `infinity`, and `minBound` - `Zero`.

ListLike Peano
Converts a given peano number to a linked list. A function `toList` always produces a lazy list,
and it is possible to converts an infinity to a linked list:
>>>take 10 <| toList infinity

LongLike Peano
Converts a given peano number to a 64-bit integer. A function `toLong` is strict and will evaluate
the whole peano number.

IntLike Peano
Converts a given peano number to a 32-bit integer. A function `toInt` is strict and will evaluate
the whole peano number.

Absolute Peano
Provides an instance for an `Absolute` class. A function `abs` in this instance is equivalent to
an infinity, and a function `signum` returns either zero (if its operand is zero) or one and never
returns a negative number.

Integral Peano
Provides an instance for an `Integral` class. Both `div` and `quot` implement an integral division
truncated towards zero. These functions are also lazy.

Modulo Peano
Provides an instance for a `Modulo` class. Both `mod` and `rem` implement a lazy modulus function.

Ring Peano
This instance provides implementations for multiplication and power functions. Both multiplication
and power are lazy functions.

Additive Peano
Provides an instance for an `Additive` class. An implementation of addition is lazy and never overlows
(as soon as the upper bound for a peano number is infinity). An implementation of subtraction is lazy
as well, however, it can raise an exception if a result is less than zero (because the lower bound for
a peano number is zero). A negation function always raises an exception, exception of the case when
applied to zero.

Enum Peano
Provides implementations for `Enum` class. 
Functions `succ` and `pred` are lazy. Function `pred` can raise an exception when applied to zero.//br
Functions `enumFrom` and `enumFromTo` are implemented by converting a peano number to a 32-bit 
integer, generating a range of 32-bit integers and than converting the resulting list of 32-bit
integers to a list of peano numbers.

Ord Peano
Provides an implementation for an `Ord` class. All functions in this instance are lazy, however they
could result in a non termination if both operands are infinity.
>>>5? > 2?

Eq Peano
Provides an implementation for an `Eq` class. All functions in this instance are lazy, however they
could result in a non termination if both operands are infinity.
>>>42? <> 42?

Show Peano
Provides an implementation of a `showf` function. This implementation is strict and will evaluate the
whole peano number. It would result to a non-termination if applied to an infinity.
>>>show (5? + 2?)

zero
A constructor for a peano number, returns a peano representation for a zero number. This constant
always requires a qualified access.
>>>zero

one
A constructor for a peano number, returns a peano representation for number one. This constant
always requires a qualified access.
>>>one

infinity
A constructor for a peano number, returns a peano representation for an infinity. This constant
always requires a qualified access.

fromInt
Converts a given 32-bit integer to a peano number. This is a lazy function.
This function always requires a qualified access.

fromLong
Converts a given 64-bit integer to a peano number. This is a lazy function.
This function always requires a qualified access.

fromIntegral
Converts a given 32-bit integer or 65-bit integer to a peano number. This is a lazy function.
This function always requires a qualified access.
>>>fromIntegral 5

listLength xs
Calculates a length of a given list in a lazy manner.

? x
This is an alias for a `fromInt` function. As soon as an operator `?` has a high priority,
parenthesis can be omitted in many cases:
>>>2? * 4?
However, when an expression like `2?` is used as a function argument, parentheses are required.

add x y
Sums two peano numbers in a lazy manner.

subtract x y
Subtracts one peano number from another in a lazy manner. This function can raise an exception if
a result is less than zero.

subtractNeg x y
Implements a safe lazy subtraction. This function returns a pair where a first element is a sign,
represented using boolean, and a second element is a peano number. Negative numbers are presented
as `(false,*)`, and positive numbers are presented as `(true,*)`. A zero is considered to be a
positive number.
>>>3? `subtractNeg` 10?

multiply x y
Multiplies one peano number by another peano number. This is a lazy function.

power x y
Raises one peano number to a power specified by another peano number. This is a lazy function.

divideMod x y
Divides two peano numbers in a lazy manner and returns a pair where a first element is a result of
a division and a second element is a remainder.
>>>5? `divideMod` 2?
