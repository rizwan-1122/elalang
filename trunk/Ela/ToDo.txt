1. Possibly change syntax for partial application of operators, e.g. instead of (+2) use <+2>.==Reconsidered. Braces now are not needed at all.
2. Make type conversion operator (:) extendable (probably through pervasives).==Probably remove this syntax at all.
3. Move all reflection API to the standard library.==Reconsidered. API refactored but will remain the part of Ela core.
4. Think about inability to convert to other than built-in types.
5. Make sequencing operator a function. (Important)==Done
6. Traits
Add:
+ ^Clone
Change:
+ Merge ^Neg into ^Num

Problems:
+ Inability to override standard operators
+ Inability to customize operator priority and associativity
